# Alias

- If we want to create the shortcuts for our commands, we can do that as well.
- This can be done either for particular repo or globally as well
- For globally, do ls -a -> go to .gitconfig folder  -> open nano editor and edit it.
- create ALIAS under which you can write shortcuts.

 OR
- we can do that using command also: eg: ` git config --global alias.ch checkout `
